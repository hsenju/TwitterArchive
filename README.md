Twitter Archive. 

Two tabs. 

The first one displays the tweets on a user's twitter homepage by default. By typing in the search box, the user is shown the related tweet to the query via twitter. Clicking on a tweet archives it. 

The second tab is where the archived tweets are displayed. By clicking on a tweet, the user can delete the tweet from their archive.
